# MITRE ATT&CK Attack Simulations for Watchtower

## Overview

I created a comprehensive MITRE ATT&CK simulation framework to test and validate your Watchtower incident response system. This framework provides safe, controlled simulations of real-world attack techniques that security teams commonly encounter, allowing you to test your detection capabilities, incident response procedures, and AI agent effectiveness.

## What Was Built

### 1. Individual Attack Technique Simulations

I developed four core attack simulations based on commonly exploited MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

#### **T1003 - OS Credential Dumping** (`credential_dump_simulation.py`)
- **Tactic**: Credential Access
- **Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Simulates**: 
  - Mimikatz-like credential extraction behaviors
  - LSASS memory access attempts
  - Registry credential harvesting
  - Suspicious process injection activities
- **Generated Artifacts**:
  - Fake memory dump files (`lsass_dump.dmp`)
  - Registry export files (`sam_export.reg`)
  - Process execution logs
  - Incident data in JSON format

#### **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter** (`command_execution_simulation.py`)
- **Tactic**: Execution
- **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ High
- **Simulates**:
  - Malicious PowerShell execution patterns
  - Encoded command execution (common evasion technique)
  - Living-off-the-land (LOLBin) abuse
  - Hidden window execution and policy bypasses
- **Detection Points**:
  - Suspicious command-line patterns
  - Base64 encoded PowerShell commands
  - Execution policy bypass attempts
  - Remote download attempts

#### **T1012 - Query Registry** (`registry_query_simulation.py`)
- **Tactic**: Discovery
- **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Simulates**:
  - System reconnaissance activities
  - Security software detection attempts
  - Persistence mechanism setup
  - Network configuration enumeration
- **Registry Keys Targeted**:
  - System information (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`)
  - Security software locations
  - Startup program locations
  - Network configuration settings

#### **T1083 - File and Directory Discovery** (`file_discovery_simulation.py`)
- **Tactic**: Discovery  
- **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¢ Low-Medium
- **Simulates**:
  - Systematic file system reconnaissance
  - Search for sensitive document types (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`)
  - Database file discovery (`.sql`, `.mdb`, `.pst`)
  - Network share enumeration
- **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - Recursive directory scanning
  - File type-specific searches
  - Sensitive data location attempts

### 2. Orchestration Framework

#### **Master Simulation Runner** (`run_mitre_simulation.py`)
- **Individual Technique Execution**: Run specific techniques in isolation
- **Attack Chain Simulation**: Execute realistic multi-stage attack progression
- **Timing Controls**: Realistic delays between attack phases
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate attack summaries and recommendations

#### **Attack Chain Progression**
The framework simulates a realistic attack progression:
1. **Initial Reconnaissance** â†’ File Discovery (T1083)
2. **System Discovery** â†’ Registry Queries (T1012)
3. **Execution** â†’ Command/Script Abuse (T1059)
4. **Credential Access** â†’ Credential Dumping (T1003)

### 3. Watchtower Integration Layer

#### **Incident Data Generation** (`watchtower_integration.py`)
I created a sophisticated incident generation system that produces Watchtower-compatible JSON incident records:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "INC-1729123456-7890",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:30:00",
  "source": "MITRE_SIMULATION",
  "mitre_attack": {
    "technique_id": "T1003",
    "technique_name": "OS Credential Dumping",
    "tactic": "Credential Access"
  },
  "risk_assessment": {
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "impact": "CRITICAL",
    "urgency": "P1"
  },
  "response_actions": [
    "Force password reset for affected accounts",
    "Review credential stores for compromise",
    "Check for suspicious authentication activity"
  ],
  "timeline": [...],
  "technical_details": {...}
}
```

#### **Intelligent Risk Assessment**
- **Dynamic Severity Calculation**: Based on MITRE tactic impact
- **Contextual Response Actions**: Technique-specific remediation steps
- **Attack Timeline Generation**: Realistic progression timestamps
- **Evidence Correlation**: Links artifacts to specific attack phases

### 4. Safety and Ethics

#### **Completely Safe Design**
- âœ… **No Real Malware**: All artifacts are fake/simulated
- âœ… **No System Compromise**: No actual credential extraction or system modification
- âœ… **No Network Traffic**: No communication with malicious external sites
- âœ… **Temporary Artifacts**: All files created in `/tmp/` directories
- âœ… **Educational Purpose**: Designed purely for defensive training

#### **Realistic but Harmless**
- Generates authentic-looking log entries and file signatures
- Mimics real attack tool behaviors and patterns
- Creates forensic artifacts that SOC analysts would expect to see
- Triggers the same detection mechanisms as real attacks
